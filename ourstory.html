            <p>Everything started with a dream and a pair of skilled hands.
                In the early 1950s, three friends left Japan and journeyed to the UK with nothing but a deep love for
                sushi
                and a dream to share their culture.
                What began as a small sushi counter in a quiet British neighborhood grew into a legacy shaped by
                passion,
                precision, and pride.

                    A black-and-white glimpse into our humble beginnings — the founders preparing sushi by hand in a
                    modest
                    kitchen, introducing the art of Japanese cuisine to their new community with care, respect, and
                    heart.</p>

                    SORA Sushi officially opened its doors in the UK. With warm lights, a cozy interior, and authentic
                    recipes,
                    the restaurant quickly became a local treasure where people gathered for honest food and human
                    connection.

                    A new generation took the helm — children of the founders who embraced innovation while preserving
                    tradition. The restaurant expanded, the sign grew bolder, and SORA became a beloved symbol of
                    cultural pride
                    and culinary excellence.
